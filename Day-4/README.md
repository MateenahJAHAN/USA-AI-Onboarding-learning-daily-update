# Day 4 - Python Requests Library and API Authentication

**Day 4 Learnings:**
- Explored Requests library quickstart documentation
- Successfully installed requests library using pip
- Learned how to make HTTP requests (work in progress)
- Explored different types of API calls in Python (building on Day 3 Postman work)
- Generated a GitHub classical token for API authentication
- Developed understanding of personal access tokens
- Technical skills acquired:
  - Python syntax for API calls
  - Understanding HTTP status codes
  - Using personal access tokens for authentication
- Practiced Python basics on Edabit (very easy)

**LLM Usage:**
- Used Claude to break down complex API concepts
- Used ChatGPT for guided step-by-step code implementation
- Asked LLMs to explain technical terms in simple language

**Challenges:**
- Initial confusion with terminal commands
- Understanding Python interactive mode
- Navigating authentication processes
- Confusion about where and what to write in terminal

**Questions for Clarification:**
- How can I further improve my API interaction skills?
- Are there recommended best practices for API authentication?
- Can we do database API calls from BigQuery?

**Next Steps:**
- Continue exploring API topics
- Practice more with Python requests library
- Work on easy, moderate Edabit challenges
