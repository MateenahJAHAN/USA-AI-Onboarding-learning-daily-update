Day 5 - API Exploration and Practice

1. OpenAI API Exploration

Created 3 API keys for OpenAI
Attempted to test them using Postman
Made an error by pasting the key in both authorization and header fields
Lost free attempt credits due to this mistake
Gained clarity on how to properly test OpenAI API in Postman

2. Free API Practice

Used a free API app to explore random user API
Copied the API endpoint code
Used JSON formatter to better understand the data structure
Watched videos to deepen understanding of JSON data
Successfully tested the same random user API using Python in terminal
Saved the results in a .py file

3. Coding Practice Platforms

Started solving problems on Edabit
Edabit subscription was too expensive
Transitioned to GeeksforGeeks for practice problems

Learning Challenges
1. OpenAI API Configuration

Challenge: Incorrectly configuring API keys in Postman
Lesson Learned: Authorization and headers are different fields with specific purposes
Impact: Lost free API attempt credits
Solution: Gained understanding of proper API authentication setup

2. JSON Data Understanding

Challenge: Initially struggled to understand JSON data structure
Approach: Used JSON formatter and watched educational videos
Outcome: Better comprehension of JSON format and structure

3. Platform Accessibility

Challenge: Edabit requiring expensive subscription
Solution: Found alternative learning platform (GeeksforGeeks)


Key Takeaways

API Authentication: Understanding the difference between authorization headers and regular headers is crucial
Learning from Mistakes: API mistakes can be costly (literally), but provide valuable lessons
Data Formats: JSON is a fundamental format for API responses - worth investing time to understand
Resource Flexibility: Having alternative learning platforms is important when hitting paywalls
Practical Application: Successfully transitioning from theory (watching videos) to practice (terminal execution)
