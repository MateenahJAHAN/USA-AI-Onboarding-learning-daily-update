Day 9 Learning: API Testing and Implementation
Overview
Today I continued my journey into API interaction and testing, focusing on:

Building a Flask API
Creating and testing HTTP requests
Using Postman for API testing
Beginning API test automation

1. Python Requests Library
I began by implementing a basic script to interact with the JSONPlaceholder API using Python's requests library.
pythonimport requests
import json
print("Script is running!")

def simple_request_demo():
    """
    A simple demonstration of basic GET and POST requests
    """
    print("===== Simple API Request Demo =====")
    
    # get
    print("\nMaking a GET request...")
    get_response = requests.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1')
    print(f"Status code: {get_response.status_code}")
    print("Response body:")
    print(json.dumps(get_response.json(), indent=2))
    
    # post
    print("\nMaking a POST request...")
    post_data = {
        'title': 'New Post',
        'body': 'This is the content of my new post',
        'userId': 1
    }
    post_response = requests.post(
        'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', 
        json=post_data
    )
    print(f"Status code: {post_response.status_code}")
    print("Response body:")
    print(json.dumps(post_response.json(), indent=2))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    simple_request_demo()
Output:
Script is running!
===== Simple API Request Demo =====

Making a GET request...
Status code: 200
Response body:
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "sunt aut facere repellat provident occaecati excepturi optio reprehenderit",
  "body": "quia et suscipit\nsuscipit recusandae consequuntur expedita et cum\nreprehenderit molestiae ut ut quas totam\nnostrum rerum est autem sunt rem eveniet architecto"
}

Making a POST request...
Status code: 201
Response body:
{
  "title": "New Post",
  "body": "This is the content of my new post",
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 101
}
2. Flask API Implementation
I built a custom Flask API to understand server-side API implementation. This API supports CRUD operations for a simple post management system.
Flask API Server Output:
Starting Flask API server...
API available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/
Available endpoints:
  GET    /posts
  GET    /posts/<id>
  POST   /posts
  PUT    /posts/<id>
  DELETE /posts/<id>
 * Debugger is active!
 * Debugger PIN: 135-509-750
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
3. HTTP Requests Testing
Created a test file (flask_api_test.http) to test all CRUD operations on the Flask API:
http### Get all posts
GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/posts

### Get a single post
GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/posts/1

### Create a new post
POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/posts
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "New Test Post",
  "body": "This is a test post created via HTTP request",
  "userId": 2
}

### Update a post
PUT http://127.0.0.1:5000/posts/1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "title": "Updated First Post",
  "body": "This content has been updated"
}

### Delete a post
DELETE http://127.0.0.1:5000/posts/2
Challenges Encountered and Solutions
1. Flask API Script Error
Issue:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/mateenahjahan/Documents/api_assignment/flask_api.py", line 1, in <module>
    flask_api.py
    ^^^^^^^^^
NameError: name 'flask_api' is not defined
Solution:
The error was caused by accidental inclusion of the filename in the file itself. Created a new file with the correct content to resolve this issue.
2. POST Request Content-Type Error
Issue:
When making POST requests to the Flask API:
415 UNSUPPORTED MEDIA TYPE
Did not attempt to load JSON data because the request Content-Type was not application/json
Solution:
The error occurred because the Content-Type header wasn't properly set in Postman. Added the appropriate header (Content-Type: application/json) which resolved the issue.
Previous Work (Day 7)
I previously explored API test automation with FreeCodeCamp materials:

Created a workspace named "FreeCodeCamp - API Test Automation"
Learned how to extract data from API responses (focusing on order_ID)
Practiced writing pre-request and post-request scripts
Used console.log for debugging API responses
Explored status codes, products, and client-side interaction
Implemented order creation and response handling
Also explored the Twilio API through a video tutorial
