# Day 2 - Database Integration and API Storage


- PostgreSQL database fundamentals
- Created databases and tables for API request logging
- Implemented table relationships (api_requests and api_users)
- Used JOINs, foreign keys, and complex queries
- Created indexes and views for performance optimization
- JSON data format and parsing
- Made API calls to GitHub using Python requests library
- Stored and queried JSON data in PostgreSQL
- Built database relationships for API data analysis

**LLM Usage:**
- Used Claude for concept clarification
- Used Claude for debugging assistance with "role 'freecodecamp' does not exist" error
- Used Claude to understand difference between creating APIs vs storing API data
- Used Claude to explain JSON in simple terms using practical examples

**Challenges:**
- Session timeout in GitPod requiring PostgreSQL restart
- Initial errors with database creation and user setup
